Angular webapp starter
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ekrtf/angular-express-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ekrtf/angular-express-starter)

## Idea

Yet another angular starter kit? Yes... but hang on.
For this one let's stop using bower and gulp, npm does it all!

## Stack

| Frontend   | Backend |
|------------|---------|
| Angular    | Express |
| SASS       |         |
| Browserify |         |
